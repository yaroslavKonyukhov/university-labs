# Simple iteration method
- It is used to find x's approximately when solving systems of linear algebraic equations. Therefore, it is not an exact method, but an approximation method.
- We can represent the system of equations as a matrix A and right-hand side vecor b.
- Important requirement: the sum of the off-diagonal elements of the matrix must be less than the diagonal element.
