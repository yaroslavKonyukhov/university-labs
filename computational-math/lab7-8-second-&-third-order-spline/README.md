# Spline of the second and third order
- The idea behind a spline is the same as a linear spline. Higher order splines provide greater accuracy. They also require more known points.
- Spline of the second order(quadratic) has third order of approximation. To use it we need at least three known points/nodes.
- Spline of the third order(cubic) has fourth order of approximation. To use it we need at least fourth known points/nodes.
- I've written the algorithm that can do interpolation of any order. So it works for the spline of any order.
- The algorithm is based on Newton's interpolation formulas.
- The first formula:
- y(x) = Pn(x) = y0 + q * deltaY0 + q(q-1)/2! * delta^2Y0 + ... + q(q-1)...(q - n + 1)/n! * delta^nY0.
- q = (x - x0)/h
- h = xi+1 - xi
- deltaY = yi+1 - yi
- delta^2Y = deltaYi+1 - deltaYi
- The second formula:
- y(x) = Pn(x) = yn + q * deltaYn-1 + q(q+1)/2! * delta^2Yn-2 + ... + q(q+1)...(q + n - 1)/n! * delta^nY0.
- Remainder term R:
- Rn(x) = h^(n+1) * (q(q-1)...(q-n))/(n+1)! * f^(n+1)(E)
- f^(n+1) is the derivative of a function of order (n+1). E is the point at which the derivative gives its maximum value.
- Or: Rn(x) = (delta^(n+1)Y0)/(n+1)! * q(q-1)...(q-n).
- Remainder term R for second formula:
- Rn(x) = h^(n+1) * (q(q+1)...(q+n))/(n+1)! * f^(n+1)(E)
- Rn(x) = (delta^(n+1)Yn)/(n+1)! * q(q+1)...(q+n).
